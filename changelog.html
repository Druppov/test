Please refer to Security Management Guide under Self-study section for additional information about security levels.</li>
              <li class="ch-updated"><strong>IDs in Provisioning API</strong><br>Renamed code related fields in Provisioning API. resellerCode, merchantCode, merchantAccountCode and portfolioCode fields were renamed to resellerId, merchantId, accountId and portfolioId respectively.
